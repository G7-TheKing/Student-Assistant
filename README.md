# Student-Assistant
A chatbot built using DialogFlow to schedule and answer questions on day to day jobs 
# Working
The framework loads in a hard-coded timetable initially, it then works on a query-based model as to whether we need any additions or deletions to our pre-existing timetable. Features include alerts on overlap of events.
